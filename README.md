# Public Key Encryption Demo

This repository demonstrates public-key encryption using OpenSSL with specific directories for sender (Bob) and receiver (Alice).

## Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/byteshiva/public-key-encryption-demo.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd public-key-encryption-demo
    ```

3. **Run Nix Develop:**
    ```bash
    nix develop
    ```

This will set up the necessary environment for the public key encryption demo.

Feel free to explore the `sender_bob` and `receiver_alice` directories, run the public key encryption script, and observe the encrypted and decrypted messages.
